<p>“It was only a dream.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s a common enough expression to be a cliché, but to those living with&nbsp;<a href="https://psychcentral.com/disorders/nightmare-disorder-symptoms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nightmare disorder</a>, the phrase brings little comfort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nightmare disorder is characterized by frequent nightmares that cause distress or impair your ability to function during everyday activities such as work or social situations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And even if you don’t have this disorder, you’re likely familiar with the occasional bad dream. A&nbsp;<a href="https://healthline.com/health/nightmares">nightmare</a>&nbsp;might cause you to wake up and they often leave you with a lasting feeling of fear or stress.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/sleep/imagery-rehearsal-therapy">Imagery rehearsal therapy (IRT)</a>&nbsp;is one commonly used treatment method for nightmare disorder.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Researchers in Switzerland recently published a&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2022.09.032" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>&nbsp;in the journal&nbsp;<em>Current Biology</em>&nbsp;in which they combined IRT with targeted memory reactivation (TMR). The results might have you sleeping easier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s take a look at what they found and how you might be able to put those bad dreams to bed.</p>

<h2><a>What are the therapies for nightmare disorder?</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, we need to understand IRT, which is already used as a way to reduce nightmare frequency and intensity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“[You] write down the bad dream in a very detailed version and then create endings for nightmares that are nonfrightening.,”&nbsp;<a href="https://www.northwell.edu/find-care/find-a-doctor/sleep-medicine/dr-thomas-michael-kilkenny-do-11364888" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Thomas M. Kilkenny</a>, MS, DO, FAASM, FCCP, the director of the Institute of Sleep Medicine at Staten Island University Hospital in New York, told Healthline.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They are written down and rehearsed over and over as one would rehearse an act in a play. In essence, the patient is writing a new ‘ending to the script’ of the nightmare, thereby making it a more pleasant outcome,” Kilkenny explained.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The goal is that, with practice, your unconscious mind learns to follow the new script to its happier ending after a nightmare has begun.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this newly published study, the 36 participants were split into 2 equal-sized groups.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both groups practiced IRT, but the second group additionally used TMR.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://siliconpsych.com/team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Alex Dimitriu</a>, the founder of Menlo Park Psychiatry &amp; Sleep Medicine in California and BrainfoodMD, told Healthline that TMR works by associating a stimulus — such as a specific sound — with a specific thought while you’re awake.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Then when the same sound is played during sleep, the brain re-activates this memory. In the case of nightmares, if a tone can be associated with a positive ending to the nightmare, playing that sound while the person is dreaming should help reactivate the positive memory that was rehearsed while awake,” explained Dimitriu.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Participants in the TMR group of this study listened to a sound while they imagined the better ending to their dream during IRT.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Participants in both groups wore a special headband at night that played the same sound when they entered the rapid eye movement (REM) stage of sleep associated with dreaming.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After two weeks, those who had listened to the sound during waking IRT experienced fewer nightmares per week. They also had more dreams with positive emotions like joy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>Reactions to the nightmare therapy study</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The experts had favorable reactions to how the study was performed and the results it produced.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m delighted to see such a relatively gentle intervention yield such a positive result,” said Dimitriu.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of particular interest was that when participants were surveyed 3 months later, they all reported fewer nightmares per week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those in the TMR group had more pronounced results than those in the IRT-only group.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The study demonstrates again that IRT alone works to improve nightmare disorder, but the new twist is that the addition of TMR to IRT not only improves [nightmare disorder] but also increases the amount of positive dream experiences,” said Kilkenny.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>Treatment for nightmares</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the results of this study are encouraging, it might be difficult to implement them on your own.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you’re experiencing frequent or intense nightmares, it may be helpful to first address your sleeping habits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Anyone struggling with nightmares should check a few basic biological systems,” said Dimitriu.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are five things he recommends investigating:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"type":"1"} -->
<ol type="1"><li>Find out if you might have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/sleep-apnea/effects-on-body">sleep apnea</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/restless-leg-syndrome">restless legs syndrome</a>.</li><li>Make sure you are getting&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/sleep/sleep-calculator">enough sleep</a>&nbsp;with regular bed and wake times.</li><li>No&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods-with-caffeine">caffeine</a>&nbsp;past noon, and no&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/how-long-does-alcohol-stay-in-your-system">alcohol</a>&nbsp;within 3-4 hours of bedtime. No&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/what-time-should-you-stop-eating">late dinners</a>.</li><li>Make sure there is no real-world source of the nightmare.</li><li>Seek professional help if you’re experiencing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety-dreams">anxiety</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/healthy-sleep/depression-and-sleep">depression</a>, or have a history of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/post-traumatic-stress-disorder">trauma</a>.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you’re interested in TMR but don’t have a headband with a built-in electroencephalogram, you might be able to use other sound triggers, such as a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/sleeping-with-fan-on">fan</a>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pink-noise-sleep">white noise</a>&nbsp;machine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The important point is to have the external stimuli be able to be associated with the thoughts one wishes to remember,” said Kilkenny.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The other therapy that has been proven to work on nightmares in PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) is the medication&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/drugs/prazosin-oral-capsule">prazosin</a>. Other behavioral therapies that may be considered for treatment of PTSD-associated nightmares based on low-level evidence include Exposure, Relaxation, and Rescripting Therapy, Sleep Dynamic Therapy; Hypnosis, Eye-Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing, and the Testimony Method,” said Kilkenny.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The experts recommend that if you need help managing your nightmares, consult with a primary care physician, sleep specialist, or mental health professional.</p>
